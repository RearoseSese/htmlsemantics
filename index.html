        <p>Being a self being one‚Äôs own self, in particular is the most familiar of all experiences.<br> 
            Indeed it is one‚Äôs self that is experienced as having one‚Äôs experiences: one‚Äôs sensations,<br> 
            emotions, memories, feelings of agency, feelings of thinking, deciding and acting,<br> 
            the very feeling of existing. Philosophical traditions encourage us to know ourselves,<br> 
            but also to not take ourselves too seriously and to not get too caught up with the wanting,<br> 
            thinking, deciding and acting ‚Äúego‚Äù part of the self. But what is this self experience, <br>
            why do we have it, and what happens if it starts to unravel? I‚Äôll suggest that we should<br> 
            marvel at the experience of the self, and speculate as to why we have it.</p>
